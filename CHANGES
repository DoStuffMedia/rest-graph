== rest-graph 1.1.1 -- 2010-05-21
* Add oauth realted utilites -- authorize_url and authorize!
* Fixed a bug that in Ruby 1.8.7-, nil =~ /regexp/ equals to false.
  It is nil as expected in Ruby 1.9.1+

== rest-graph 1.1.0 -- 2010-05-13
* Main repository was moved to http://github.com/cardinalblue/rest-graph
  Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll keep pushing to both repositories until
  I am too lazy to do that.

* Better way to deal with default attributes, use class methods.

* If you want to auto load config, do require 'rest-graph/auto_load'
  if it's rails, it would load the config from config/rest-graph.y(a)ml.
  if you're using rails plugin, we do require 'rest-graph/auto_load'
  for you.

* Config could be loaded manually as well. require 'rest-graph/load_config'
  and RestGraph::LoadConfig.load_config!('path/to/rest-graph.yaml', 'env')

== rest-graph 1.0.0 -- 2010-05-06
