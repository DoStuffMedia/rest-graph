= rest-graph changes history

== rest-graph 1.1.0 -- ?
* Main repository was moved to http://github.com/cardinalblue/rest-graph
  Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll keep pushing to both repositories until
  I am too lazy to do that.

* Introduce RestGraph#multi to do multiple api call concurrently.
  to use this feature, you'll need to run RestGraph inside a eventmachine
  event loop and install em-http. (And you may want async-rack if you're
  doing rack application too.)

* Better way to deal with default attributes, use class methods.

* If you want to auto load config, do require 'rest-graph/load_config'
  if it's rails, it would go to config/rest-graph.y(a)ml to load up
  if you're using rails plugin, we do require 'rest-graph/load_config'
  for you.

* Config could be load manually as well.
  RestGraph::LoadConfig.load_config!('path/to/rest-graph.yaml', 'env')

== rest-graph 1.0.0 -- 2010-05-06
* now access_token is saved in data attributes.
* cookies related methods got renamed, and saved all data in RestGraph
* parse failed would return nil, while data is always a hash

== rest-graph 0.9.0 -- 2010-05-04
* renamed :server option to :graph_server
* added :fql_server option and fql support.
* cookies related parsing utility is now instance methods.
  you'll need to pass app_id and secret when initializing
* if sig in cookies is bad, then it won't extract the access_token

== rest-graph 0.8.1 -- 2010-05-03
* added access_token parsing utility

== rest-graph 0.8.0 -- 2010-05-03
